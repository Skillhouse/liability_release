of any damage, loss or injury to the participant or the participant’s
property while upon the premises or using any equipment of the
organization or while participating in any of the activities
contemplated by this agreement whether such loss, damage, or injury
results from the negligence of the corporation, its members, agents,
or from some other cause.

\section{COVENANT NOT TO SUE}

The participant agrees never to institute any suit or action at law
otherwise against Gainesville Hackerspace, its members, officers,
board members, agents, nor to initiate or any way assist the
prosecution of any claim for damages or course of action which the

have by reason of injury to the person of the member or to the
participant’s property arising from the activities contemplated by
this agreement.

\section{THIRD PARTY INDEMNIFICATION}

The member will indemnify, save and hold harmless Gainesville
Hackerspace, its members, officers, board members, or agents from any
and all losses, claims, actions, or proceedings of every kind and
character which may be presented or initiated by any other persons or
organizations and which arise directly or indirectly from the actions
of the member while engaged in the activities contemplated by this
agreement.
